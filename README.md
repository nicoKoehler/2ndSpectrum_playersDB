#IMPORTANT NOTE

As indicated on my application, I am not familiar with REACT. While I consider it my great strength to learn quickly, the alotted time was not sufficient to grasp how diferent react components interact. 
Instead, I decided to recreate the basic app in vue.js I tried to submit the files as time expired, so I am not sure if they made it through. 
In addition, I will send you my git repo where I uploaded the code, so you can convince yourself of its functionality. 
Incidentally, if you compare both code basis, you can see that the vue.js is a little leaner than its react equivalent - which is why I chose this as my preferred framework. That said, I would be happy to learn a new framework should it be required, but I wanted to note the capabilities of Vue. 

As I could not push to the hackerrank repo anymore, I had to create my own repo, which is why the commit times will appear off. However, you can compare these files to the ones that were (hopefully) submitted via the Hackerrank IDE and see that this was not worked on after the challenge was over.
